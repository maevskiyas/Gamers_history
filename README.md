# Gamer's History ðŸŽ®  

## Overview  
**Gamer's History** is a Flask-based web application that allows users to create, organize, and manage their personal video game libraries.  
The project was built as the final project for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) and is designed to demonstrate practical web development skills with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and front-end integration.  

With **Gamer's History**, players can:  
- Import games from external platforms (currently Steam, with plans for Epic Games and GOG).  
- Manually add games with custom details.  
- Upload and display **cover images** for each game.  
- Track **hours played**, add personal notes, and rate their games.  
- Switch between **list view** (table-based) and **grid/tile view** (visual cards).  
- Enjoy multilingual support with English and Ukrainian translations.  

The goal of the project is to provide gamers with a simple but powerful way to keep track of their collections, reflect on their gaming history, and share it with others.

## Features  

### User Authentication  
- Secure login and registration system based on **username** (not email).  
- Passwords are securely hashed before storage.  
- Session management handled via **Flask-Login**.  

### Game Management  
- Add, edit, and delete games from your personal library.  
- Edit includes updating title, platform, year, hours played, and rating.  
- Duplicate prevention: the same game cannot be added twice.  

### Cover Uploads  
- Users can upload local images or fetch covers from external APIs.  
- File validation ensures only safe extensions (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`).  
- Covers are stored in the `static/uploads` folder.  

### Views  
- **List view:** shows games in a table with hours, ratings, and edit/delete actions.  
- **Tile view:** shows games as cards with cover images and quick stats.  
- Users can switch views via toggle buttons.  

### Ratings & Playtime  
- Each game in the library can be rated on a scale of 1â€“10.  
- Hours played are stored as numeric values and displayed in both views.  

### Internationalization  
- **Flask-Babel** handles translations.  
- Language can be switched via `?lang=uk` or `?lang=en`.  
- Translations stored in `translations/en/` and `translations/uk/`.

## Design Decisions

Flask over Django: lightweight, minimal boilerplate, perfect for CS50 project scope.

SQLite: simple, file-based DB ideal for personal apps. Can be replaced with PostgreSQL/MySQL in production.

Username-based login: avoids complexity of email verification.

Two view modes: inspired by Steam/Epic UI, giving users choice of data-focused or visual browsing.

CSRF protection: all forms include CSRF tokens via Flask-WTF.

---

## Internationalization

All templates use _('text') for translatable strings.

babel.cfg specifies extraction rules.

Workflow:

pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot .
pybabel update -i messages.pot -d translations
pybabel compile -d translations


Add new language by creating a new folder under translations/ and repeating the update/compile steps.

## AI Assistance
Some parts of this project were developed with the help of AI tools:
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) for code snippets (form handling, pagination, etc).
- GitHub Copilot for auto-completion in Flask routes.
